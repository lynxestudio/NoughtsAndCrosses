# Nought And Crosses

<p>
Noughts and Crosses (also known as tic-tac-toe) is one of the oldest games in the world. In the game, two players take turns to put either a nought or a cross into a grid that measures 3x3 (three columns across and three rows high). One player only places noughts in the boxes and the other only places crosses.
