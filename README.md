# Nought And Crosses (also known as tic-tac-toe)

<p>
It is one of the oldest games in the world. In the game, two players take turns to put either a nought or a cross into a grid that measures 3x3 (three columns across and three rows high). One player only places noughts in the boxes and the other only places crosses.

To win the game, a player has to place either three noughts or three crosses in a line, either horizontally (across), vertically (up and down) or diagonally. The other player must try to stop them. The first person to get three in a row wins.

Noughts and Crosses is a turn-based game, which means that the players take it in turns. When it's a player's turn, that player is in control of what happens in the game, while the other players must wait until it is their turn. Turn-based games are very common, and many board games, such as chess, work in this way. They are popular as players must use strategy to win.
